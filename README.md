## 🎪 The Great Redesign of 2024

Hey there, fellow code enthusiasts and bot aficionados! 👋

Remember that Discord bot website I created three years ago? The one that somehow became the second most starred repo on my GitHub profile? Well, it's back, and it's had more work done than a celebrity before awards season! 🌟

### Why the Redesign?

Picture this: I'm scrolling through my GitHub profile, basking in the glow of my incredible projects, when suddenly, I spot it. The Akemi bot website, sitting there like that embarrassing photo from your high school yearbook. You know, the one with the questionable haircut and the "I'm too cool for school" attitude?

I couldn't let it sit there, gathering digital dust and judging me with its outdated UI. So, I did what any self-respecting developer would do: I put on my redesign pants (yes, they're a thing) and got to work!

### License
This project is licensed under the "Please Don't Use This For Evil" license. Also known as MIT, but the first one sounds cooler.

Created with ❤️ and an unhealthy amount of energy drinks by lordofsunshine.

*P.S. If this repo surpasses my top starred project, I promise to redesign it again in another 3 years. Maybe by then, we'll have AI that can make better jokes than me!*
